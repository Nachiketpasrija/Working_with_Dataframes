# Assignment 1 â€“ Working with Dataframes

## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to Assignment 1, which focuses on creating and manipulating a data frame in R. In this assignment, I followed specific instructions to create a data frame, append an "age" column, and set up a GitHub repository for the project.

## Data Frame Description
The data frame "dframe" is structured as follows:
- **person**: Character vector
- **sex**: Factor with levels F (Female) and M (Male)
- **funny**: Factor with levels Low, Med, and High

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Frame Creation**:
   - Created the "dframe" data frame with the provided variables "person," "sex," and "funny."

2. **Age Column Appending**:
   - Appended the "age" column to the "dframe" data frame as instructed. Age information was added for each person.

3. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Created a GitHub repository for this assignment, including a README.md file and the R script.

## Files
Key files in this repository include:
- `create_data_frame.R`: R script for creating the data frame and appending the "age" column.

## Sample Output
There are no specific visualizations in this assignment. The primary goal was to create and manipulate the data frame as per the instructions.

## Submission
Please submit the GitHub repository link on Brightspace (d2l).
